# codesparks-pmd-demo

This is a plugin project for the IntelliJ IDEA. It is crafted with the help of the CodeSparks framework for 
demonstration purposes. As data source serves PMD (https://pmd.github.io/) which is used to option the Cyclomatic 
Complexity values for Java classes and methods. Using the functionality of the CodeSparks framework, the Cyclomatic
complexity is visualized in-situ, i.e. embedded in the source code in a sparkline manner using a glyph-based
visualization approach.
