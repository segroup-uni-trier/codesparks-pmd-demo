# codesparks-pmd-demo

This is a demo implementation of a CodeSparks plugin for the IntelliJ IDEA that can be used as a template for further plugins. It makes use of the PMD Java API (https://pmd.sourceforge.io/pmd-6.29.0/pmd_userdocs_tools_java_api.html) to calculate the cyclomatic complexity of Java classes and methods in the current project. With the help of the CodeSparks framework, the source code is augmented with glpyh-based visualizations that represent the values of the cyclomatic complexity and their interpretation.
